# Iris-Plant-Dataset-Classification-Tool-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-And-Tkinter-GUI
A simple machine learning tool uses Tkinter GUI to classify the Iris plant dataset and guess the iris class using machine learning algorithms.

![Main GUI](main_gui.jpg)

# The Machine Learning algorithms used in this project are:

  1- Support vector machine (SVM).
  
  2- Random Forest Classifier (RFC).
  
  3- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  
  
  # How does the tool work?
  
  The working process of this tool goes through three steps as follow:
  
  # Step 1: 
  Choose the iris dataset file by hitting the (Load CSV Dataset) button, then choose the file from the file browsing dialog that appears.

  # Step 2: 
  Apply machine learning algorithms & Select the best accuracy by hitting the (Calculate Accuracy) button.

  # Step 3:
  Defining a new machine learning model to calculate the mean absolute error by hitting the (Define Model) button.
